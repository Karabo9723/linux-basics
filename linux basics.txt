Task 2 : Absolute and Relative Paths

Create an empty file named exercise.md and move this file to the /tmp directory, using a relative pathname. Then, delete this file using an absolute pathname.

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ touch exercise.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ mv exercise.md /tmp/
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ rm exercise.md../../


Task 3 : cat commands


1. Create 3 files namely umuzi.md, recruits.md and cohort.md.
Fill all 3 files with contents of your choice. Maybe some nice poems about you MUB experience.

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ touch umuzi.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ touch recruits.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ touch cohort.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ nano umuzi.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ nano recruits.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ nano cohort.md



2. Write a script that concatenates the content of umuzi.md, recruit.md, cohort.md and displays the result on the screen.

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ cat umuzi.md
MUB was awesome
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ cat recruits.md
MUB was great
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ cat cohort.md
Umuzi was a great learning experience


3. Write a script that takes the content of umuzi.md, cohort.md and recruits.md to print/store the output into a new file named summary.md.

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ find . -type f iname '*.recruits.md' >> summary.md
find: paths must precede expression: `iname'
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ find . -type f -iname '*.recruits.md' >> summary.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ find . -type f -iname '*.cohort.md' >> summary.md


4. use the command line to append the words “The End” to summary.md. Be careful not to overwrite the exiting contend

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ cat summary.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ echo 'The End' >> summary.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ printf "The End\n" >> summary.md


Task 4 : The locate command

1. Write a script to help you locate a file named umuzi

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ locate umuzi

2. Write a second script that will search for the same file and send the result of the search to a file named search_result.md

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ locate umuzi
/home/recruit/workspace/umuzi.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ locate umuzi > search_results.md


Task 5 The locate command cont...

1. Create a file within Documents directory, add to is a file named pad.md

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace$ mkdir Documents

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/workspace/Documents$ touch pad.md

2. Change the working directory to Desktop, then create a folder and name it work

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~$ cd Desktop
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Desktop$ pwd
/home/recruit/Desktop
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Desktop$ touch work


3. Copy pad.md to the currently working directory as pad_copy.md

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Desktop$ pwd
/home/recruit/Desktop
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Desktop$ touch pad.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Desktop$ cp pad.md pad_copy.md

4. update the database used by locate by running locate updatedb.

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Desktop$ locate updatedb

5. change the working directory to the previous one (cd -)

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Desktop$ cd ../Documents
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Documents$ 

6. use locate to find pad_copy.md

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Desktop$ cd ../Documents
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Documents$ locate pad_copy.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~/Documents$ sudo updatedb
[sudo] password for recruit:

/home/recruit/Desktop/pad_copy.md


Task 6 Find commands

Write a second command that takes the result of the previous search and copy into a folder of your choice.

recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~$  find . -type f -iname '*.pdf' >> results.md
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Music     Public      Templates  workspace
Documents  Pictures  results.md  Videos
recruit@recruit-OptiPlex-380:~$ cat results.md
./Downloads/Report.pdf
